# Getting started

The following steps should get you up and running with a local development environment. This will be sure to change over time so if you have any issues please shout up!

- [Install git](https://git-scm.com/downloads "Install git") - git looks after all your swappies and shares
- [Clone](https://github.com/robinkemp/WitchesHat.git, "Clone") the witches hat repository - this is your copy of our witchy cauldron
- [Install VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download, "Install VS Code") - VS Code is a super lightweight environment to work in
- [Install Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/, "Install Node JS") - its what the cool kids do
- [Install Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/installation.html, "Install Vue CLI") - Vue does the clever front end stuff for us, the CLI gives it bovver boots
- Open up your witches hat, check for frogs
- From a terminal <code>run npm install</code> - this gets you all the freebie stuff we can't live without
- From a terminal <code>npm run serve</code> - this is where the magic happens
