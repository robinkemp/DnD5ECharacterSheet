# What Can I Do

Its so early in the project right now the question is more what can't you do

- Prettiness - The overall frame needs to not burn eyes
- Language - Enhance our [Ubiquitous Language](https://github.com/robinkemp/WitchesHat/blob/main/Docs/UbiquitousLanguage.md "Ubiquitous Language") - I'm especially interested in the character sheet and its interelations
- Feature Requests - [Anything you want](https://github.com/robinkemp/WitchesHat/blob/main/Docs/FeatureRequests.md "Feature Requests")
- Use Cases - [Convert](https://github.com/robinkemp/WitchesHat/blob/main/Docs/UseCases.md "Use Cases") those features into actions we can do
- Domain Design - What is our [DDD model](https://github.com/robinkemp/WitchesHat/blob/main/Docs/Domain.md "Domain")

Above all just have fun and play with it
