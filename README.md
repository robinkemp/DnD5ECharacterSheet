# Witches Hat

What is Witches Hat?

Its a side project to play around with code, tech, and develop some fun DnD tools.

You don't need to be a coding wizard to get involved, there are many aspects. Knowing about DnD, having ideas, making things look nice, breaking stuff, hell just being generally enthusiastic...

Initially I'd like to be able to manage my character sheet in a browser, mostly because I'm fed up of the three dialogs Adobe put me through just to save! I can see opportunities to push this into creating a character, levelling up a character, GM tools to be able to quickly look stuff up (passive wisdom check?), much potential I think.

Hopefully we can come up with some cool stuff for us, and maybe even at some point other people will want to play with our tools.
